Please create a "pages" folder and put 1. "For_You_Menu.py" and 2. "Youtube_Chef.py" in the folder, with the "main.py" and "chat_mode.py" outside of the "pages" folder.

Be sure to check out the README in .streamlit as without the secrets.toml and config.toml, the streamlit application will not work properly.
