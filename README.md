## Our Issue and Motivation
The team want to create something unique, as Thai people. We want to share the Thai cuisine, which is loved worldwide for its flavors, but many people lack the cooking skills and knowledge of proper condiments, which can result in unsatisfying results.
We want to create something that can be used to help solve this problem and spread Thai culinary culture, and recipe that we, Thai people, have been enjoying in our everyday's life.

## Objective
To make Thai cooking accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are. Our goal is to help those who find it hard to source authentic Thai ingredients by suggesting local adjustments that still deliver the true taste of Thai cuisine.

## Solution (Methodology)

###The Challenge: Traditional Recipes

Manual Search: Users have to manually scour the internet for recipes that match their dietary needs.

Rigid Instructions: Standard recipes list fixed ingredients, leaving home cooks stranded if they can't find a specific item.

Lack of Flexibility: Users often struggle to adapt flavors (like spiciness or sweetness) to their personal preference without ruining the dish.

###The Solution: Chef-AI

Personalized Analysis: Uses AI to analyze user preferences, including spiciness levels, flavor profiles, and dietary restrictions.

Smart Substitution: Automatically suggests recipes with customizable ingredients, offering viable local alternatives for hard-to-find items.

Interactive Guidance: Provides step-by-step cooking instructions tailored to the modified recipe.

Continuous Learning: The system learns from user feedback to improve future recipe and substitution recommendations.
