# Chef-AI: Your Personal Thai Food Assistant
This is a personal group project with the aim of sharing the culture of Thai cuisine with the world, by removing the biggest barrier to entry: <ins>**ingredient availability**</ins>.

With the help of our AI, focusing on its specialization in harmony of sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavors, as well as its wide knowledge in ingredient substitution, you will be able to create any Thai dish with ingredients widely available in your country!

The dataset have 145 Thai food, including its ingredients and how to make said food, as well as a visualization analysis of food and ingredients.
Users will be able to search and find the Thai food they want, and recreate it with the help of our personal AI Chef.

## Our Issue and Motivation
The team want to create something unique, as Thai people. We want to share the Thai cuisine, which is loved worldwide for its flavors, but many people lack the cooking skills and knowledge of proper condiments, which can result in unsatisfying results.
We want to create something that can be used to help solve this problem and spread Thai culinary culture, and recipe that we, Thai people, have been enjoying in our everyday's life.

<br>

## Objective
To make Thai cooking accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are. Our goal is to help those who find it hard to source authentic Thai ingredients by suggesting local adjustments that still deliver the true taste of Thai cuisine.

<br>


## Solution (Methodology)

### The Challenge: Traditional Recipes

- Manual Search: Users have to manually scour the internet for recipes that match their dietary needs.

- Rigid Instructions: Standard recipes list fixed ingredients, leaving home cooks stranded if they can't find a specific item.

- Lack of Flexibility: Users often struggle to adapt flavors (like spiciness or sweetness) to their personal preference without ruining the dish.

### The Solution: Chef-AI

- Personalized Analysis: Uses AI to analyze user preferences, including spiciness levels, flavor profiles, and dietary restrictions.

- Smart Substitution: Automatically suggests recipes with customizable ingredients, offering viable local alternatives for hard-to-find items.

- Interactive Guidance: Provides step-by-step cooking instructions tailored to the modified recipe.

- Continuous Learning: The system learns from user feedback to improve future recipe and substitution recommendations.

# Visualization (Streamlit + Plotly)

Chef-AI uses **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to help users explore Thai recipes and ingredients in a more visual and interactive way, especially on the page **“Which menu for you”**.

### 1. Recipe Distribution by Main Protein

On the **“Which menu for you”** page, the app displays a Plotly **bar chart** that shows how many recipes belong to each main protein group, for example:

- Pork  
- Beef  
- Prawn  
- Chicken  
- Fish  
- Other  

This chart is generated by querying the recipes stored in DuckDB and counting how often each protein type appears in the recipe data. This gives users a quick overview of which types of dishes are most common in the dataset.

</p>

### 2. Interactive Filtered Recipe Table

Below the bar chart, the app shows an **interactive table** of recipes:

- When no bar is selected, the table shows **all available recipes**.

</p>

- When the user selects a bar (for example “Chicken”), the table is filtered to show **only recipes that use that protein**.

</p>

This combination of bar chart + filtered table helps users:

- Discover which kinds of Thai dishes are available for each protein.
- Quickly browse recipes that match their ingredient preference.

### 3. Integration with the AI Chef (Optional)

From this visualization, users can then:

- Pick a recipe from the table.
- Switch to the **AI Chef mode** and ask follow-up questions about that dish.

This makes the visualization not only descriptive, but also a starting point for interactive, AI-assisted cooking guidance.
