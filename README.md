## Our Issue and Motivation
The team want to create something unique, as Thai people. We want to share the Thai cuisine, which is loved worldwide for its flavors, but many people lack the cooking skills and knowledge of proper condiments, which can result in unsatisfying results.
We want to create something that can be used to help solve this problem and spread Thai culinary culture, and recipe that we, Thai people, have been enjoying in our everyday's life.

## Objective
To make Thai cooking accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are. Our goal is to help those who find it hard to source authentic Thai ingredients by suggesting local adjustments that still deliver the true taste of Thai cuisine.
